#Improvement Areas
1. UI can be more better like list style, color, font etc.
2. I have saved only the image url data in local storage and added the attribute for image data also but not saved and fetch image data right now (Can be implemented in future schope).
3. pagination implemented but it needs more improvement like loader in the bottom. Pagination Imaplemented only for the remote data. We can implement it for local data also
4. Not implemented any loader/Activity indicator (future schope- can be implememented while data fetching).
5. We can improve our objective c wrapper class
